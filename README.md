Welcome to the BMI calculator

To calculate your BMI, first choose your method of measurement (via the radio buttons)
then enter your weight and height.
Click on Calculate to get your result.

Personal notes:
I get the program to work.
However the Jasmin tests are failing for the UI.
Thinking it could be related to the setting of the radio button?
Ran all the tests (as written in Jasmine) in the console (when loading the index page) and then it works fine. The program runs as it should and gives the expected BMI results.
So I need help in finding out why the tests are not working. I have looked at this alot (also together with Rodrigo).
A personal thought is if the tests have to be paused momentarily to allow the textboxes and buttons to be shown?
So in summary, the program works, but the UI related tests are failing.
